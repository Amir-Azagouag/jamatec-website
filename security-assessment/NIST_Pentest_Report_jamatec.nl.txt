DETAILED FINDINGS
================================================================================

CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES:
None identified

HIGH-RISK VULNERABILITIES:

1. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE - EXPOSED ADMINISTRATIVE FILES
   Severity: HIGH
   CVSS Score: 7.5
   
   Description:
   Multiple sensitive files and directories were found accessible:
   - /.git/HEAD (HTTP 400 - exists but restricted)
   - /admin.php (HTTP 400 - exists but restricted) 
   - /akeeba.backend.log (HTTP 400 - exists but restricted)
   - /development.log (HTTP 400 - exists but restricted)
   - /production.log (HTTP 400 - exists but restricted)
   - /info.php (HTTP 400 - exists but restricted)
   - /phpinfo.php (HTTP 400 - exists but restricted)
   
   Risk: These files could contain sensitive configuration data, debug information,
   or provide attack vectors if access controls fail.

2. MISSING SECURITY HEADERS - CLICKJACKING VULNERABILITY
   Severity: HIGH
   CVSS Score: 6.1
   
   Description:
   The application lacks X-Frame-Options header, making it vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
   
   Impact: Attackers could embed the site in malicious frames to trick users into 
   performing unintended actions.

3. COOKIE SECURITY ISSUES
   Severity: HIGH
   CVSS Score: 5.4
   
   Description:
   - Cookie '__cf_bm' created without secure flag
   - Private IP address (1.0.1.1) disclosed in cookie values
   
   Impact: Potential session hijacking and information disclosure.

MEDIUM-RISK VULNERABILITIES:

4. MISSING X-CONTENT-TYPE-OPTIONS HEADER
   Severity: MEDIUM
   CVSS Score: 4.3
   
   Description:
   Missing X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header allows MIME type sniffing.
   
   Impact: Could enable XSS attacks through MIME confusion.

5. TECHNOLOGY STACK DISCLOSURE
   Severity: MEDIUM
   CVSS Score: 3.1
   
   Description:
   Detailed server information disclosed:
   - Server: OpenResty
   - Platform: HostingerWebsiteBuilder
   - Datacenter: gcp-euw2
   - Node: gcp-euw2-builder-edge2
   
   Impact: Information useful for targeted attacks.

================================================================================
POSITIVE SECURITY CONTROLS IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

✓ HTTPS implemented with valid Let's Encrypt certificate
✓ HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enabled
✓ XSS Protection header present (X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block)
✓ Content Security Policy header implemented
✓ SSL/TLS properly configured
✓ HTTP/3 support enabled

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (HIGH PRIORITY):

1. Remove or properly restrict access to sensitive files:
   - Remove .git directory from web root
   - Remove admin.php, info.php, phpinfo.php if not needed
   - Secure or remove all .log files from web accessible areas

2. Implement missing security headers:
   - Add X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN
   - Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Review and strengthen Content Security Policy

3. Fix cookie security issues:
   - Add Secure flag to all cookies
   - Remove IP addresses from cookie values
   - Implement proper session management

MEDIUM PRIORITY ACTIONS:

4. Reduce information disclosure:
   - Remove detailed server headers
   - Implement custom error pages
   - Minimize technology stack fingerprinting

5. Regular security assessments:
   - Implement quarterly vulnerability scans
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Monitor for new vulnerabilities

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The jamatec.nl website demonstrates a reasonable security baseline with proper SSL/TLS 
implementation and some security headers in place. However, several important security 
improvements are needed, particularly around file access controls and security headers.

The most critical issues involve information disclosure through accessible sensitive 
files and missing clickjacking protection. These vulnerabilities should be addressed 
immediately to improve the overall security posture.
