I will run a Nikto scan on `jamatec.nl` to check for web server vulnerabilities. This scan will identify potential security risks like outdated software and misconfigurations. The results will be saved to `nikto_scan.txt`.Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "web_fetch"?
I can't use the tools I originally planned. I'll use the available tools to analyze `jamatec.nl`.

My new plan:
1.  **Initial Reconnaissance:** I'll fetch the HTML of `jamatec.nl` to look for clues about its technology stack.
2.  **Technology Identification:** I'll use web search to find out what software `jamatec.nl` uses.
3.  **Manual Vulnerability Testing:** I'll manually try to inject simple XSS and SQL injection payloads into the site's URLs.
4.  **Directory Traversal:** I'll try to access files outside the web root using directory traversal payloads.

I'll start by fetching the website's content.

I will begin by enumerating subdomains for "jamatec.nl" to identify any potentially vulnerable test or forgotten subdomains. I'll start by examining the `/home/mocrovn/Tools/` directory to see if a suitable subdomain enumeration tool is already available.Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry.

I need to find a subdomain enumeration tool. Since I can't use `run_shell_command`, I'll use `list_directory` to inspect the `/home/mocrovn/Tools/` directory instead.The `Tools` directory is empty, so I'll search for a subdomain enumeration tool elsewhere. The `htb/`, `net_recon/`, and `projects/` directories seem like good places to check. I'll start with `htb/`.The `htb` directory is a dead end for enumeration tools. I'll check `net_recon` next; it sounds more promising.`net_recon` is a dead end. I'll check `projects` now, just in case.`projects` has potential. I'll check `pentesting` and `scripts` for tools, starting with `pentesting`.`pentesting` has a `ghostcrew` directory. I'll check it.`ghostcrew` seems to be a project. I'll start by listing the contents of its `tools` directory, then I'll examine `requirements.txt` for any useful Python tools.The `ghostcrew/tools` directory seems specific to the "mcp" project. I'll check `requirements.txt` to see if it has any subdomain enumeration tools and get a better sense of its purpose.I need to find a subdomain enumeration tool for jamatec.nl. I've checked several directories, including `Tools`, `htb`, `net_recon`, and `ghostcrew`, but haven't found anything suitable. Now I'll check `projects/scripts` for custom scripts.The `projects/scripts` directory is empty, so I've run out of obvious places to find a subdomain enumeration tool. I'll use `google_web_search` to find an online tool, as that's the most efficient option. I'll search for "online subdomain enumeration tool".I'll use HackerTarget.com's Subdomain Finder to enumerate subdomains for jamatec.nl. I'll use `web_fetch` with the prompt: "Please go to https://hackertarget.com/find-host-records/ and find the subdomains for jamatec.nl".
